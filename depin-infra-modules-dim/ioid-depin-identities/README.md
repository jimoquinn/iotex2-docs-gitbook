# \[ioID] DePIN Identities

{% hint style="info" %}
**ioID**, designed by IoTeX, is a unified identity system that utilizes blockchain wallet addresses (both EOA and AA wallets) as **on-chain identities** and DIDs as **off-chain identities**. It is designed to effectively manage both on-chain and off-chain digital relationships among participants in DePIN applications.
{% endhint %}

As a general-purpose identity system, ioID could be utilized in different layers of the DePIN modular infrastructure, as shown in the figure below:
